    <h1>Quest Rules:</h1>
    <p>The player has one day to complete all of the quests. <br> He may use one of the following life lines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Phone a friend</li>
      <li>Google research</li>
      <li>Ask loving girlfriend to assist</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Upon completion of each quest, the player will be rewarded with adoration, and various displays of affection from loving girlfriend.</p>
    <p>Once all the quests have completed, the player will be rewarded with a meal, the oppourtunity to put his boerewors into a bun (which has been cut through the top), followed by some well-earned gaming time.</p>
    <p>The player has the choice between a co-op, split screen game involving two animated voodoo dolls made by a child, a souls game, a racing game, or an RPG game of his choosing.</p>
    <p>The player may use the gaming console of his choosing.</p>
    <p>The option of pipe smoking is allowed, if the player so chooses.</p>
    <p>The player is encouraged to drive like a normal person between each quest, as to not fling loving girlfriend around the inside of the white chariot.</p>
