  <h3>The Tale of a Man with Many Tasks...</h3>
  <p><strong>Scythe, <em>Knight of Roodepoort</em></strong>, from <strong><em>The House of Pepler</em></strong> is an honest, hardworking, hansdome, bear-man with a new journey ahead of him. Many struggles lie in the wake of his bygone endeavours.
    His daily service to <strong>Wil, <em>Earl
        of Rivonia,</em> </strong> from <strong><em>The House of Porsh</em></strong>, has been a tiresome campaign. Circa the year <em>2014 BCE,</em> Scythe began his duties for the <em>House of Porsche</em>.
    Scythe's personal responsibilities have been hindered by the duties which he has been charged with since the commencement of his service to the <em>House of Porsh</em>. These monotonous and perpetual duties
    rendered our knight a Nihilist, ailing with fatigue and pessimism.</p>
  <p>Unbeknownst to Scythe, his fatigue was not indissoluble, and his pessimism was not perrenial. All he needed was the affections of a maiden to crack open the clouds of darkness clutching his faculties of perception of the
    world around him, to allow for light to slowly seep in to give him the strength to set him on a path unencumbered by others.</p>
  <p>One lonely eve in the early days of July, <em>2020 BCE</em>, as he paged through <em>The Book of Faces</em>, he was reminded of an ethereal maiden he was once in pursuit of. Her name was <strong>Carla, <em>Lady of
        Middelburg</em></strong>, from <strong><em>The House of Barnes.</em></strong> This maiden was intrepid with otherworldy curiosity, and set off on journeys that would take her miles away from the homeland. She set out as an artist on a
    futurist oceanic vessel. This journey soon came to an end when she caught word of her father falling ill, and she returned to take care of him.</p>
  <p>While this maiden was homebound, she learned some new skills, and once she gained some experience, she set off on a new journey to a far away oriental world of technologies and bizarre delicaces, with a vast landscape of territories to explore.
    In pursuit of immersing herself into the local culture, she found employment as an educationist where she taught unruly youth her native language so that they could one day, too, set off on other worldy journeys. </p>
  <p>Through <em>The Book of Faces</em>, Scythe became knowledgable of the fact that it was soon to be the anniversay of Carla's date of birth. Unsure if he would be reciprocated with a
    response, he sent word for birthday blessings on the eve of the 9th of July. He was indeed, met with a response. Their fondness for each other flourished with tender affection and reverence for one another as they continued to
    exchange words with one another. But Carla was bound by her contractual duties as an educationist and was unable to return to Scythe, <em>Knight of Roodepoort</em>, from <em>The House of
      Pepler</em></p>
  <p>Many months passed and brought with them more obstacles to keep the two entangled hearts apart. A deadly plague swept over all the lands and brought a halt to all journeys that travellers desired to make. To her dismay,
    Carla stopped recieving word from Scythe. She lost all hope and decided to extend her contractual duties in the far east.</p>
  <p>Scythe grew lonely while the world remained in isolation. He sought to find company in the arms of a mistress. None of the mistresses he courted from the masses at <strong><em>The Mistress Market of Hinge</em></strong>
    possessed the prowess maintain a long-lasting enchantment on the Knight, and he believed he was destined to settle for a maiden that was beautiful, but challenged him at every turn.
  </p>
  <p>One dreadful Autumn morning, Carla caught word that her mother had fallen ill. The medical practioners in care of Carla's mother believed that the matron would make a slow, but full recovery. But alas,
    her mother fell prey to plague and lost the strength to continue battling her illness. Carla grew more and more concerned for her mothers mortality and decided to make the perlious journey back to the motherland. She was too
    late and her mother departed from world of the living. Carla sent word of her return to Scythe and shortly afterwards arrived on home soil to bid farewell to her mother in a Celtic ceremony inline with the matrons Gaelic herritage.</p>
  <p>Sir Scythe came to the realization that an oppourtunity lay ahead of him. He abandoned the Jezebel attempting to sequest him from any other maidens and mistresses potentially worthy to gain his affections. He requested to meet Carla at a tavern
    which was established in the year 1969 to console her sorrow over her loss. She arrived clothed in savage robes, and adorned in tribal markings and metal trinkets that pierced her skin. Upon seeing each other, the two felt a shift in their beings
    and knew that they had found home.</P>
  <p>Scythe stayed at Carla's side and she regained her strength, while she in turn started cracking open his dark clutchings. Little by little, Scythe was liberated from his fatugue and unshackled by his pessimism. He now has his own new journey to
    take... One in which he sets out to fufil his personal duties. One where he starts with small responsibilities and continues on to expeditions that will set him free from the clutches of Sir Wil, <em>Earl
      of Rivonia,</em> from <em>The House of Porsh</em>. </p>
  <p>And now, before him, a long journey lies ahead...</p>
  <p><strong>Good luck, bear-man. May your find the strength to complete your quests...</strong></p>
